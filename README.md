# SnowClaude

A single-page web app for tracking accumulated snowfall anywhere on the map. Search for places, save your favorites, and visualize snowfall with an interactive color-coded overlay.

## Features

- **Place search** -- Find any location using the search bar (powered by Nominatim/OpenStreetMap geocoding). Click a result to fly to it on the map and see its snowfall data.
- **Click-to-inspect** -- Click anywhere on the map to get snowfall data for that point, with reverse geocoding to show the place name.
- **Saved places** -- Save locations to a persistent list in the sidebar. Each card shows accumulated snowfall at a glance. Saved places are stored in `localStorage` and survive page reloads.
- **Custom names** -- Rename saved places with inline editing for quick identification.
- **Snowfall summary** -- For each location, see total snowfall over the last 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, plus how many days since the last snow.
- **Snowfall overlay** -- A color-coded heatmap rendered on the map showing snowfall intensity across the visible area. Includes a time period picker (1d/2d/3d/7d), opacity slider, and legend.
- **Mobile responsive** -- On narrow screens, the saved places panel becomes a slide-out overlay toggled by a hamburger menu.

## Architecture

The entire app is a single `index.html` file with no build step, no bundler, and no framework. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all inline.

### External dependencies (loaded via CDN)

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) | Interactive map rendering and layer management |

### APIs used (all free, no API keys required)

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) | Daily snowfall data. Used for both per-location snowfall summaries and the batch grid queries that power the map overlay. |
| [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) | Forward geocoding (place search) and reverse geocoding (click-to-name). Provided by OpenStreetMap. |
| [OpenStreetMap Tiles](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) | Base map tile layer. |

### How the overlay works

When the map viewport changes, the app:

1. Divides the visible area into a 12x8 grid of sample points.
2. Fetches snowfall data for all 96 points in a single Open-Meteo API call (comma-separated coordinates).
3. Sums daily snowfall over the selected time window (1/2/3/7 days) for each grid point.
4. Renders a smooth heatmap by bilinearly interpolating the grid onto a 180x120 canvas.
5. Maps snowfall values to an icy color ramp (light cyan -> sky blue -> teal -> deep indigo) and displays it as a Leaflet `ImageOverlay`.

Updates are debounced (500ms after the user stops panning/zooming) and previous requests are aborted if the viewport changes again.
